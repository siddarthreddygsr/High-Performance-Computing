# Conway's game of life

My understanding: Conway's Game of Life is a simulation of life that is played on a grid. Each square on the grid can be either alive or dead. The game follows a set of rules that determine which cells will be alive or dead in the next generation based on the cells that are currently alive or dead. The rules create interesting patterns and behaviors that can be unpredictable and sometimes even look like living organisms. It's not a game that you can "win" or "lose", but rather a way to explore the behavior of a simple system.

The code is very will written with proper comments and every function is self explainatory
